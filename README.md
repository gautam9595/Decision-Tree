## Handling of Continuous Valued dataset
The [Liver](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/liver+disorders) dataset is being used to test the model's performance which is a continuous valued dataset so, we need to find the candiate thresholds for an attribute and repeat this for each attribute. so that at the end, we will select the best attribute with it’s threshold to split the tree. we are using the method given in the book ‘Machine Learning, by Tom Mitchell’
